# Churn-Prediction-using-pySpark

## REQUIREMENTS:  
     Spark (versions depending on the current one)
     Python 3.7 (or any other compatible versions)
     pySpark package implemented in an IDE (Pycharm)

I use the PyCharm IDE because it is easy to set up a pySpark environment in PyCharm, without disturbing the default python installation.
Folks who prefer to do it the easyway can have python installed through Anaconda, but I wouldn't recommend it.

The datasets are available in the following kaggle page.
